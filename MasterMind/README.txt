MasterMind

Overview:
This program is a virtual take on the board game Master Mind. It is a code breaking game where one player 
will set a code and the other will try to break it (in this case the code is randomly generated). 
Turn by turn the player will place four colored pieces into their respective slots. If a game piece is in a 
correct slot it will be indicated by a black peg placed on the board, if a white peg is placed that means 
that a correct colored piece is on the board, but in the wrong position. If no peg is placed then that color 
is not in the code. The pegs are placed at random and do not have any indication of certain slots. You have ten 
chances to guess the code correctly. In this rendition you will select a color, then select the slot you wish
the color to go in. Once all four slots are filled you hit the submit button and then the pegs will be placed. 
There is also a get a hint button which will show one piece of the final code per selection of the get a hint button.
